✅ Client-Friendly Explanation of the Difference Between the Two Measures

Below is a simple explanation of why the “Last Year Sales” calculation looks different in the 196 report compared to the 212B report.


---

1. How the 196 Report Calculates Last Year Sales

In the 196, the logic is very direct:

It goes to the weekly sales table

It looks at last year’s fiscal period

It adds up all the units sold last year

It includes only valid RS = 1 records


In other words:

> The measure in the 196 report simply totals last year’s sales based on the filters applied.
Nothing more, nothing less.



This is a straightforward “last year same period” calculation.

2. How the 212B Report Calculates Last Year Sales (LY FYTD)

The 212B report works differently because it is a Fiscal Year-To-Date (FYTD) report that follows promo-month rules, not just standard fiscal calendar rules.

Instead of directly adding up last year’s sales, the 212B measure does this:

It checks whether the current month is the “current promo month”

Based on that, it selects one of two pre-calculated LY-FYTD values:

Current month’s LY FYTD value, or

Previous month’s LY FYTD value



In other words:

> The 212B measure is not calculating sales on its own — it is choosing which LY-FYTD value to display based on the promo-month logic used in this report.



This design supports the business rule that 212B should reflect promo-aligned FYTD performance, not just a simple last-year total.

3. Why the Two Measures Are Different

The two reports serve different business purposes:

196 Report

Weekly view

Standard fiscal-year logic

Straight sum of last year’s units

Does not depend on promo-month logic


212B Report

Fiscal Year-To-Date performance

Promo-calendar driven

Needs to pick the correct LY-FYTD value (current vs previous month)

Uses conditional logic instead of directly summing sales



---

4. Summary

The 196 report calculates last-year sales directly from the sales data.

The 212B report selects between two FYTD last-year values based on promo-month business rules.

Because the business requirements are different, the DAX logic looks different.

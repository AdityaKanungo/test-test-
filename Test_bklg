Below are three polished, presentation-ready slides summarizing:

Scenario A (1-Year Index Window)

Scenario B (2-Year Index Window)

Combined Comparison / Key Takeaways


They are written in a clear client-friendly tone and structured so you can paste directly into PowerPoint or Google Slides.

📊 Slide 1 — Scenario A: Index GPS Window = 1 Year

Survival Analysis: Index GPS → Subsequent CPS (1-Year Index Window)

Index Period: Oct 1, 2023 – Sept 30, 2024
Follow-up: Up to Sept 30, 2025 (max 2 years)


---

Key Findings

CPS escalation is rare:
3.72% (50 of 1,344 children) escalated to CPS within 2 years.

Strong survival curve:
~97.7% are CPS-free at 1 year,
~96.5% remain CPS-free at 2 years.

Median time to CPS among event cases only: 221.5 days
(Does not represent the average child; only those who escalated.)

Event timing pattern:
Most CPS events occur early—within 0–60 days after the index GPS referral.



---

Interpretation for Stakeholders

When an index GPS occurs early in the window, children have a full 2 years of observation, increasing the likelihood of detecting CPS events.

Nevertheless, escalation remains exceptionally low, suggesting the majority of GPS referrals do not transition into CPS involvement over the next two years.

The early event concentration signals the need to focus early post-GPS interventions for the small group at highest risk.

📊 Slide 2 — Scenario B: Index GPS Window = 2 Years

Survival Analysis: Index GPS → Subsequent CPS (2-Year Index Window)

Index Period: Oct 1, 2023 – Sept 30, 2025
Follow-up: Until Sept 30, 2025 (variable follow-up times)


---

Key Findings

Even lower CPS escalation rate:
2.67% (70 of 2,621 children).

Survival curve remains extremely high:
~98.3% CPS-free at 1 year,
~97.3% CPS-free at 2 years.

Median time to CPS among event cases: 96.5 days

Reason for lower CPS risk:
Many children enter later in the study period, resulting in shorter exposure time, and thus fewer opportunities to escalate.



---

Interpretation for Stakeholders

Adding Year 2 index referrals enlarges the cohort with children who have limited follow-up (e.g., index referrals in 2025).

These later entrants naturally have less “time at risk,” producing lower observed CPS rates.

Despite broader inclusion, escalation remains rare, reinforcing that the GPS → CPS pathway occurs in a very small subset of cases.

📊 Slide 3 — Combined Insights & Recommendations

Comparison of Scenarios A & B

Metric	Scenario A (1-Year Index)	Scenario B (2-Year Index)

Total Children	1,344	2,621
CPS Events	50	70
Event Rate	3.72%	2.67%
Censor Rate	96.28%	97.33%
Median Time to CPS (Events Only)	221.5 days	96.5 days
CPS-Free at 2 Years	~96.5%	~97.3%



---

Key Combined Observations

CPS escalation is consistently low in both scenarios (2–4%).

Survival curves remain near 99% for long periods, indicating most children do not escalate to CPS after a GPS referral.

Event timing differs:

Scenario A shows later events due to more uniform 2-year follow-up.

Scenario B shows earlier events among those who escalate, due to shorter observation windows.


Both analyses confirm: GPS referrals rarely transition into CPS cases.



---

Recommendations for Policy & Practice

Prioritize early-risk assessment: events cluster within the first 60 days.

Provide targeted follow-up only for high-risk subgroups (e.g., sexualized behaviors, repeated GPS referrals).

Continue population-level monitoring but focus resources on the small minority of GPS cases that escalate.

Consider further stratification by referral subtype to identify specific risk drivers.

If you want, I can also:

✔ Add visuals on the slides

✔ Build a PowerPoint file with design & charts

✔ Add stratified insights (e.g., sexually acting out vs not)

✔ Add risk tables (1-year, 2-year cumulative CPS risk)

Just tell me which version you prefer.

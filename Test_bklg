Here’s a clean, client-ready single slide you can drop into your deck.

Power Analysis – What Our Sample Size Can and Cannot Tell Us

Why we did this

To understand whether our current data has enough CPS events to reliably detect differences in CPS risk between subgroups (e.g., different GPS types, sexually acting out vs others) using survival analysis.



---

Data reality

CPS events are rare in both scenarios:

Scenario A (1-year index): 50 CPS events out of 1,344 children (3.7%)

Scenario B (2-year index): 70 CPS events out of 2,621 children (2.7%)


In survival analysis, statistical power is driven by the number of events, not just total sample size.



---

What we can detect with current events (80% power, α = 5%)

With ~70 events (Scenario B), we have good power to detect roughly a 2x increase in CPS hazard between two groups

Example: CPS risk ~3% vs ~6%


With ~50 events (Scenario A), we need an even larger difference (~2.2x) to be confident it is real.



---

What we are under-powered to detect

We do not have enough CPS events to reliably detect moderate differences, such as:

HR ≈ 1.5 (e.g., CPS risk 3% vs 4–5%)


To detect these smaller but meaningful differences, we would need ~3× more CPS events

Practically: more years of data and/or combining multiple regions or cohorts.

Key takeaway for leadership

> Our current dataset is excellent for estimating overall CPS risk after a GPS referral and for flagging large risk differences between groups (when one group is about twice as likely to reach CPS).
However, because CPS escalation is rare, we are not yet powered to confidently detect smaller increases in risk without additional data (more time or more jurisdictions).
CPS escalation is consistently low in both scenarios (2–4%).

Survival curves remain near 99% for long periods, indicating most children do not escalate to CPS after a GPS referral.

Event timing differs:

Scenario A shows later events due to more uniform 2-year follow-up.

Scenario B shows earlier events among those who escalate, due to shorter observation windows.


Both analyses confirm: GPS referrals rarely transition into CPS cases.

Recommendations for Policy & Practice

Prioritize early-risk assessment: events cluster within the first 60 days.

Provide targeted follow-up only for high-risk subgroups (e.g., sexualized behaviors, repeated GPS referrals).

Continue population-level monitoring but focus resources on the small minority of GPS cases that escalate.

Consider further stratification by referral subtype to identify specific risk drivers.

If you want, I can also:

✔ Add visuals on the slides

✔ Build a PowerPoint file with design & charts

✔ Add stratified insights (e.g., sexually acting out vs not)

✔ Add risk tables (1-year, 2-year cumulative CPS risk)

Just tell me which version you prefer.

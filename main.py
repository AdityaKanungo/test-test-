Subject: Availability for Upcoming Projects and Team Support

Hi [Manager's Name],

I hope you're doing well.

With the current pause in the Policy Engine project and the upcoming completion of Task 30 – Customer Service Center Analysis – by May 16th, I wanted to check in regarding potential next steps or upcoming projects I can contribute to.

I'm eager to stay engaged and continue adding value, so please let me know if there are any ongoing initiatives, team priorities, or areas where my support could be beneficial in the interim. I'm happy to assist wherever needed.

Looking forward to your guidance on how I can best contribute.

Best regards,
[Your Full Name]
[Your Role]

Would you like me to tailor this further to reflect a specific tone (e.g., more assertive, more collaborative)?

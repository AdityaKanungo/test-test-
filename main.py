Subject: Request for Employment Verification Letter for USCIS RFE

Dear [Manager's Name / HR Team],

I hope you're doing well. I’m reaching out to request an employment verification letter needed for my wife’s USCIS Change of Status application (from H4 to F1), as part of a recent Request for Evidence (RFE).

USCIS requires a letter on company letterhead, signed by an authorized official, confirming the following details about my employment:

Full name

Job title

Employment start date

Current work location

Current salary

Confirmation that I am currently employed with the company


I would greatly appreciate your help in providing this at your earliest convenience. Please let me know if you need anything further from me.

Thank you for your support.

Best regards,
[Your Full Name]
[Your Employee ID, if applicable]
[Your Contact Information]

Would you like me to draft the actual employer letter next?

⭐ Updated Longitudinal Dataset – Assumptions

Overview

The longitudinal dataset (LD) contains one record for every Child ID – Referral ID – Allegation ID combination. It links all validated victim matches over time and includes perpetrator context for each allegation to support analysis of recurrence, escalation, incident patterns, and child–perpetrator relationships.


---

1. Inclusion & Eligibility Assumptions

A. Valid Victim Matches Only

Only referrals where the child–victim has a valid match based on the finalized match logic are included in the longitudinal dataset.

If a child cannot be matched reliably across referrals, their records are excluded.


B. Required Identity Fields

Records missing any required identity elements (Final Name, DOB, SSN when applicable) are excluded because they cannot support longitudinal matching.


C. Expunged Data

Any referral containing expunged individuals is excluded from the LD, including both child and perpetrator contexts.

Expunged individuals are not represented in perpetrator histories, relationship fields, or linkages.


D. Referral-level Filtering

Only referrals received within the study window October 1, 2023 – September 30, 2025 are included.

2. Dataset Granularity & Structure

A. Primary Key

Each row uniquely represents:

Child Longitudinal Person ID

Referral ID

Allegation ID


This ensures each allegation appears once per child.

B. One Longitudinal Child ID

A single long_person_id is assigned to each child and persists across all referrals and allegations included in the LD.


C. Inclusion of Perpetrator Context

Each allegation row includes:

Perpetrator Longitudinal ID (when a valid match exists)

Perpetrator Person ID

Perpetrator Relationship to Child


This supports analysis of:

Repeated maltreatment by the same perpetrator

Changing relationships over time

Cross-referral linkage of perpetrator involvement


(Previously missing—now aligned with your mockup.)


---

3. Sequencing Logic

A. Ordering of Events

Records are sequenced using referral_received_date (intake date).

When multiple allegations occur within the same referral, they follow the referral date ordering.


B. Event Timeline

Incident_begin_date and incident_end_date are used for analyzing child experience over time but do not control row ordering.


C. Chronological View

For each child, longitudinal rows are presented in chronological order to support escalation analysis, recurrence tracking, and time-to-event measures.



---

4. Interpretation Assumptions

A. Victim-Centric Dataset

The LD is child-victim centric: each row reflects a child’s allegation experience.

Perpetrator data is included only as context and does not create multiple rows.


B. Household context is not inferred

The LD does not derive new household structures or infer relationships beyond what exists in the underlying referral.


C. No backward updates once expungement is applied

If an individual is later expunged, all historical records involving that individual are removed from the LD.



---

5. Data Use Limitations

The LD supports recurrence, progression, time-series, and dyad (child–perpetrator) analysis.

It does not represent children or persons who were unmatched or whose referrals fell outside the time window.

Interpretation must account for differences in how incidents are documented across referral types and sources.

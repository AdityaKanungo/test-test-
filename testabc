Great — if your calculation shows median time to CPS = 439 days, that means:

⚠️ Important clarification

This median is calculated only among the 50 children who did experience a CPS event, not the entire cohort of 1,344.

Because only 3.7% of the population had a CPS event, the Kaplan–Meier curve for the entire cohort does not drop to 0.5 (50%), so the KM population median does not exist.
But the event-only median is absolutely valid and useful.

✅ Interpretation of "Median time to CPS = 439 days"

1. What this means

> Among the children who escalated to CPS after their sexually acting out GPS index referral, half of them escalated within 439 days (~14.5 months), and half after that.



This tells you:

CPS escalation tends to be delayed, not immediate.

The trajectory is slow, with concerns building over time rather than being acute at index.

🔍 2. Combine this with survival findings

You now have:

Population-level risk

1,344 children total

50 escalated → 3.7% overall CPS escalation rate


Event-timing among escalated children

Median event time = 439 days

Most events occur in the 1 to 1.5 year timeframe

Very few events occur early (<90 days)

🎯 3. Full narrative you can use for reports / slides

> “In a cohort of 1,344 children with an index GPS referral involving sexually acting out behavior, only 3.7% (n=50) escalated to CPS within the two-year observation period.

Among the small subset who did escalate, the median time to CPS was 439 days, indicating that escalation tends to occur more than one year after the index GPS event.

This timing pattern suggests that CPS involvement for this population is typically the result of cumulative or escalating concerns, rather than immediate safety issues identified at the index GPS referral.”

📌 4. Additional quantifiable interpretation from your curve

Based on the shape of the KM curve:

Probability of remaining CPS-free

6 months: ~97%

12 months: ~96–97%

18 months: ~96%


Among the 50 events:

25% had CPS by ~350 days

50% by 439 days

75% by ~550–600 days


This aligns with the steep decline after ~350 days that your KM curve shows.

Objective:
Determine how changes in call volume and handle time impact the number of agents required to meet service level targets during peak and off-peak times.

1. Key Assumptions & Targets

Wait Time Target: 3 minutes 30 seconds

Handle Time Assumption: 7 minutes 30 seconds (450 seconds), inclusive of wrap time

Accept Rate Target: 95% — correlates with keeping average wait time at or below 3:30

2. Key Insight: Wait Time is the Primary Driver of Accept Rate

Based on our analysis of historical call center performance, we found a strong and consistent inverse relationship between average wait time and accept rate.
As wait times increase, caller abandonment rises sharply, reducing the proportion of calls accepted.

When wait times are held below 3:30, the accept rate consistently reaches or exceeds 95%.

As wait time extends to 10 minutes or more, accept rates can drop to 85% or lower.


This relationship is critical — improving accept rate hinges directly on managing wait time.

3. What Drives Wait Time?

Wait time is influenced by a combination of operational factors:

Call Volume: Higher volume increases wait times if staffing remains static.

Agent Availability: Fewer agents during peak hours significantly drives up wait time.

Average Handle Time (AHT): Longer call durations reduce call-handling capacity per agent.


Each of these levers must be actively managed to maintain performance targets — especially during high-volume periods such as LIHEAP Mondays.

4. Methodology

A. Regression-Based Forecasting Model
We built a predictive model using historical data to quantify how call volume, agent count, and handle time affect wait time and accept rate.
The model demonstrates:

A strong predictive relationship: R² = 93%

Used to simulate required staffing levels under varying call volumes and service targets


B. Scenario-Based Staffing Projections
Using fixed handle time (450 seconds), we projected agent requirements under typical and peak day scenarios to meet a 95% accept rate and 3:30 wait time target.

On peak days (e.g., LIHEAP Mondays), up to 480 agents are needed — a 25–60% increase over typical levels.

Even average-volume days require additional staff beyond historical norms to meet targets.

Slide 1: Forecasting and Analysis Tool ‚Äì Summary and Use Case

Overview: The OCYF Forecasting and Analysis Tool supports data-driven staffing and operational decision-making by forecasting call and referral volumes and assessing the impact of various staffing scenarios. It provides both baseline predictions and ‚Äúwhat-if‚Äù simulations to guide resource allocation and operational planning.

Key Use Case:

Supports ChildLine hotline operations by forecasting expected volume of calls and electronic referrals.

Helps identify necessary staffing levels based on volume trends and service expectations.

Enables proactive planning by simulating scenarios like outages or unexpected demand changes.


Core Features:

Daily and hourly forecasts of call and referral volumes

Scenario modeling based on staffing levels, assumptions, and external events

Key outputs: expected wait times, abandoned calls, and staff needs

Exportable tables and visual trends for planning and reporting


Benefits:

Improves decision-making with real-time trend analysis

Optimizes staffing to reduce wait times and missed calls

Enhances flexibility in response to emergencies and policy changes

Slide 2: Managed Identity Exception Justification

Why Managed Identity is Not Required

Tool Nature & Access Controls:

üîí No PII or sensitive data is processed or stored.

üë§ No user authentication or input is required; the tool is a closed forecasting model used for internal analysis only.

üåê Network-restricted: Only accessible from within the CWOPA network. It cannot be accessed externally or exposed to the public internet.


Purpose of Tool:

Operates strictly as a decision support utility for internal operations.

Generates outputs from preloaded datasets to support planning ‚Äì not real-time transactional processing or identity-linked services.


Why This is an Exception:

Managed identity is designed to secure access to resources where identity or user-level access control is needed. Since this tool:

does not authenticate users,

does not access or expose sensitive or protected data,

and cannot be accessed outside CWOPA‚Äôs internal network,



it meets the criteria for exception from managed identity requirements under current security policies.

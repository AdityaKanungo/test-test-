📘 Final EDA Plan (Including Survival Analysis)


---

🎯 Business Questions

#	Business Question	Analytical Goal

1	Which, if any, GPS subcategories correlate with future CPS reports?	Identify GPS types and characteristics most associated with escalation to CPS, and quantify escalation timing.
2	Do certain GPS subcategories lead to more serious future incidents over time?	Examine whether some subcategories escalate more severely (e.g., to substantiated CPS, fatality, or near-fatality).

🧭 Stage 1: Data Preparation

Objective

Prepare a clean, analysis-ready dataset for descriptive and time-to-event analyses.

Tasks

1. Data validation & cleaning

Remove duplicate ReferralIDs.

Ensure chronological order per PersonID.

Standardize and check date fields (IncidentDate, ReferralDate, ClosureDate).



2. Derived variables

Referral_sequence = rank of referral by date per person.

Days_since_previous_referral

Days_to_next_referral

Referral_type (GPS/CPS)

Escalation_flag = 1 if any CPS referral follows a GPS.



3. Event setup for survival analysis

Event_date = first CPS referral date (if any)

Event = 1 if CPS occurred, 0 if censored

Time_to_event = days between index GPS referral and CPS referral (or censor date)

Subcategory = GPS subcategory for index referral

🧮 Stage 3: Survival Analysis

Purpose

Quantify time to CPS escalation and compare across GPS subcategories.


---

3.1 Kaplan–Meier Survival Curves

Objective	Metrics / Analyses	Visualization	Statistical Tests	Interpretation

Estimate time until CPS escalation	Compute survival probability S(t) by GPS subcategory	Kaplan–Meier survival curves	Log-rank test	Determine whether escalation timing differs by subcategory
Identify median time-to-event	Median survival time (days to CPS)	KM table summary	—	Compare speed of escalation
Visualize escalation probability over time	1 - S(t) cumulative incidence curves	Line plot	—	Communicate % escalated by month


Example interpretation:

> “Children with ‘Domestic Violence Exposure’ GPS referrals have a 25% probability of CPS escalation within 120 days, compared to 10% for ‘Lack of Housing’.”

3.2 Cox Proportional Hazards Model (Optional within EDA)

Objective	Metrics / Analyses	Visualization	Statistical Tests	Interpretation

Estimate relative hazard of escalation controlling for covariates	Model: h(t) = h0(t) * exp(β1*Subcategory + β2*NumReferrals + β3*DistinctSubcategories + …)	Forest plot of hazard ratios	Wald test, Likelihood ratio test	Quantify which GPS subcategories have faster escalation risk
Assess proportionality assumption	Schoenfeld residuals	—	—	Validate model reliability


Interpretation example:

> “After controlling for number of prior referrals and case complexity, ‘Behavioral Health’ subcategory cases are 1.7× more likely to escalate to CPS (p < 0.01).”




---

⚠️ Stage 4: Severity and Outcome Analysis

Purpose

Examine whether escalation leads to more serious outcomes and whether certain GPS subcategories are linked to those outcomes.

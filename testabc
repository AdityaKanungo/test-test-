Slide 1: Approach & Objectives

    Objective:
    Investigate whether high missed calls on Monday impact call volume and performance later in the week.

    Hypothesis:
    A "High Missed Monday" creates a backlog that spills over into Tuesday/Wednesday.

    Data Used:
    Daily metrics (Entered, Offered, Accepted, Abandoned, wait times, etc.) from the Genesys platform.

Slide 2: Analysis Process

    Data Preparation:

        Calculated missed calls = Offered – Accepted.

        Flagged Mondays with high missed calls (top 25%/75th percentile).

    Feature Engineering:

        Created a dummy variable for High Missed Monday.

        One-hot encoded days of the week and built interaction terms (e.g., High_Missed_Monday × Tuesday).

    Modeling & Visualization:

        Descriptive statistics and regression analyses to test for spillover effects.

        Visualized results with Seaborn bar and line charts.

Slide 3: Key Findings & Implications

    Key Findings:

        High Missed Monday weeks show higher call volumes on Tuesday and Wednesday.

        A noticeable dip on Thursday suggests backlog clearance.

        Friday call volumes converge between groups.

    Business Implications:

        Consider increasing staffing on Tuesday/Wednesday following a High Missed Monday.

        Use real-time monitoring of Monday performance to adjust scheduling.

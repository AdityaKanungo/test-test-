Slide 1: Forecasting and Analysis Tool ‚Äì High-Level Overview

Tool Purpose: The OCYF Forecasting and Analysis Tool is an assumption-based planning solution designed to support ChildLine operations by forecasting call and referral volumes and evaluating staffing needs under various conditions. It enables scenario analysis to inform strategic decisions and operational adjustments.

Forecasting and Analysis Tool Goals:

Provide data-driven forecasts for expected hotline call and self-service referral volumes.

Enable responsive staffing adjustments by modeling a range of what-if scenarios.

Support proactive resource planning through simulation of outages, demand fluctuations, and operational assumptions.


Tool Capabilities:

Baseline Forecasts: Predict daily and hourly call and referral volumes using historical trends and updated data feeds.

What-If Scenarios: Model staffing impacts based on changes in agent availability, external events, and adjusted assumptions.

Staffing Forecasts: Calculate minimum staffing levels needed to meet expected demand and maintain service standards.

Performance Metrics: Deliver insights on estimated wait times, abandoned calls, and staffing gaps.


Key Outputs Displayed:

Forecasted call and referral volumes

Estimated pre-staff and absolute minimum staffing needs

Expected wait times and abandoned calls

Exportable tables and visual trends for operational planning

Slide 2: Managed Identity Exception ‚Äì Justification Summary

Why Managed Identity is Not Required

Tool Characteristics:

üîê No Sensitive Data: The tool does not contain or process personally identifiable information (PII) or other sensitive data.

üë• No Direct User Input: The tool operates in a read-only capacity for end users, producing output for analysis without accepting user-generated input.

üåê Restricted Access: Access is strictly limited to internal CWOPA network and machines. It is not externally accessible via the internet or open environments.


Use Case Context:

The tool is used exclusively to run forecasts and generate scenario-based analytics to inform staffing plans.

Outputs are used by internal analysts and decision-makers to support ChildLine service levels.


Rationale for Exception:

Managed Identity is designed for services requiring secure, authenticated access to sensitive systems or data. This tool:

does not handle sensitive information,

does not involve authenticated user interaction,

and is isolated from public-facing infrastructure.



Therefore, it qualifies for an exception under security policy and does not necessitate managed identity integration.

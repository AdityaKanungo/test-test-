

Here’s a meeting-ready version you can just talk through.

---

### 1. Descriptive stats & EDA (what’s actually happening in the data)

**What we do:**

* Count referrals by GPS subcategory.
* For every GPS subcategory, look forward 6, 12, and 24 months and calculate:

  * “% of kids who ever got any CPS”
  * “% who got a **high-severity** CPS” (using our 3-level CPS severity index we added)
  * most common GPS → GPS sequences before CPS.

**Why:**

* This immediately tells us which GPS subcategories even have a CPS follow-up and which ones almost never do.
* It also shows whether the relationship is stable across time windows (6 vs 12 vs 24 months).

**How it maps to the slide:**

* This is **direct evidence for BQ1** — “which, if any, GPS subcategories correlate with future CPS?”
* We can already say in plain English: “Kids starting in GPS A go to CPS twice as often as kids in GPS B within a year.”

### 2. Baseline model (GPS → CPS odds only)

**What we do:**

* Run a very simple logistic model:

  * outcome: CPS within 12 months (Y/N)
  * predictors: GPS subcategory at index (+ year, + county)
* No paths, no time-varying pieces — just “does the GPS label itself tell us anything?”

**Why:**

* Descriptives could be driven by geography or year; this step removes those easy explanations.
* If a GPS subcategory is still high after we control for county/year, then it’s a *real* signal.

**How it maps to the slide:**

* **Strengthens BQ1** — “this subcategory correlates with future CPS even after we adjust for where and when it was reported.”
* It’s also easy to show: one table of odds ratios / risk multipliers.

### 3. Survival analysis (time-to-CPS for 6m / 12m / 24m)

**What we do:**

* Build month-by-month rows after the first GPS.
* Model the chance of CPS **this month** given it didn’t already happen (discrete-time survival).
* Run it 3 times: 0–6 months, 0–12, 0–24.
* Include the GPS subcategory, age, county, **and** what happened since (new GPS).

**Why:**

* Volume alone doesn’t tell us risk — **speed** does.
* If 20% of kids in GPS A reach CPS in 3 months and 20% of kids in GPS B reach CPS in 18 months, those are two different policy problems.
* Survival is the clean way to show “A escalates faster than B.”

**How it maps to the slide:**

* **Answers BQ2** — “do certain GPS subcategories lead to a more severe incident over time?”
  Here “more severe over time” = “they step up to CPS faster.”
* **Also improves BQ1** — because we can now say “this GPS correlates with CPS and it does so early.”

**Bonus with the severity index we added:**

* we can run the same survival on “time to **high-severity** CPS” to show which GPS subcats lead to the serious stuff, not just any CPS.

### 4. Multi-state / GPS→GPS→CPS models (path view)

**What we do:**

* Treat each GPS as a “state”.
* Track how kids **move between GPS categories** before they ever show CPS.
* Then model: given this history, **which CPS (1 of 10) shows up first, and when?**

**Why:**

* Your real-world note was: “one GPS can have multiple different subsequent GPS before CPS.”
* That means the **sequence** is sometimes the signal, not just the first GPS.
* This step is the only one that can say:

  * “CSAO alone is risky, **but** CSAO → Neglect is even riskier and escalates faster.”
  * or “Supervision → Supervision → CPS-Neglect is a very common route.”

**How it maps to the slide:**

* This is the **clearest piece for BQ2** because it literally shows escalation over time and across categories.
* It also feeds back into BQ1 by telling us: “this GPS looks okay on day 1, but watch it if it changes to X.”

### 5. Special / advanced models (richer logistic / GBM)

**What we do:**

* Take all the features we built (index GPS, later GPS, counts, county, severity) and train a more flexible model (tree/GBM/XGBoost).
* Predict: CPS in next 6 or 12 months.

**Why:**

* This gives an **operational** outcome: we can rank kids by near-term risk.
* It also tells us which variables — first GPS vs subsequent GPS vs county vs services — have the strongest signal.

**How it maps to the slide:**

* **Supports BQ1** from a practical angle: “if we had to pick only 10% of cases to watch, which ones?”
* It doesn’t replace the earlier steps — it just turns the insights into a usable score.

### 6. Statistical tests / guardrails

**What we do:**

* **Chi-square** on GPS × CPS to show the association isn’t random.
* **Log-rank test** to show survival curves for two GPS groups are statistically different.
* **Likelihood-ratio tests** to show that adding “subsequent GPS” really improves the model.

**Why:**

* Makes the whole story defensible — not “we eyeballed this,” but “we tested it.”

**How it maps to the slide:**

* **Makes both BQ1 and BQ2 defensible** — we can tell the working group: “the differences we’re showing you are statistically real, not noise.”

### So, in order, the story you can tell

1. **First, we describe it** → “here’s where CPS actually happens by GPS.” (**BQ1**)
2. **Then we prove it’s real** with a small model → “even after county/year, these GPS are still higher.” (**BQ1** stronger)
3. **Then we put time in** → “some GPS escalate faster, some slower.” (**BQ2**)
4. **Then we put paths in** → “it’s not just the first GPS; some GPS→GPS paths are the real escalators.” (**BQ2** clearest)
5. **Then we make it actionable** → “here’s a score / rank of who to watch.” (**BQ1** operational)
6. **All of it is tested** → “differences are not random.” (supports **both**)

That’s the full talking version.
